The Chat has been resurrected to connect people again!

# Features:
* Full chat functionality in all mp modes (Ranked, Custom lobby, Campaign, Battle)
* emojis support via \`\` Ex \`mazda\`
* string random colorization support via ~~. Ex ~GL HF~
* Hotkey config. Create '_enable_chat_hotkey.txt' in a game folder (where exe is) and write a hotkey Ex. F2, shift_F2, ctrl_F2 (on one line w/o spaces) normal letters are not supported
* Refresh button in case you suspect chat isn't working properly (happens when you're the only one in a lobby and someone just joined your lobby)

# TODOs / Known issues
* implement support for drag&drop in minimized mode
* Color randomization is not fully random (lua issue)
* Custom command system
